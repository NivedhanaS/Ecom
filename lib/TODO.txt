List what all changes needs to be done in app including UI(Ui what kind of changes required) -->

The color combination of the app can be improved. Instead of using random colors like
violet widgets in the Shop List section and random yellow, red, and blue colors in the
Category List section, a proper color theme should be implemented to make this app look
more elegant and trustworthy.
In the shop list section, shops can be classified into various genres such as electronic
gadgets, clothes & accessories, appliances, toys, etc.Each genre will have a list of shops
that fall under it, making it easier for users to navigate and find what they are looking for.
This classification system helps users to quickly locate the type of shops they are
interested in and streamlines the shopping experience.
In the profile page, the icons need to be changed. Relatable icons will make the overall
user experience more intuitive and visually appealing. It need to be ensured that the
icons are consistent in style and color scheme for a cohesive look.
The rating feature in the product details section may be confused with the 'wishlist'
feature. The 'heart shape' icon does not accurately represent a rating feature, a star icon
or something similar would be more appropriate. It is important for the design team to
consider this confusion and make necessary adjustments to ensure a clear distinction
between the rating and wishlist features. This could include changing the icon to better
represent the rating feature, such as using stars or a thumbs up symbol. By making these
changes, users will have a more intuitive experience navigating the product details
section.
In the carousel slider, the heart shaped icon isnâ€™t functioning.This should be taken care
of.
A voice search option & visual search option can be added in the search bar which will
make it more user-friendly and convenient for users to find what they are looking for
quickly and easily.
In this app, a red button is used for 'Buy Now', 'Check out', and multiple times on the
payment pages. However, red color does not symbolize safety or security.Therefore, it
might be beneficial to consider a more appropriate color scheme that aligns with trust
and security, such as a calming green or a reassuring blue. These subtle adjustments can
greatly improve the overall user experience and inspire more confidence in the payment
process.
The boring font style need to be cared for this app.The font style is crucial for user
experience and readability. It should be visually appealing and easy on the eyes to ensure
users can navigate the app effortlessly. A boring font can make the app seem
unprofessional and uninviting. It's important to choose a font that matches the overall
design aesthetic and enhances the user interface.
A social sharing option can be implemented in the product details section. It allows users
to share products or their shopping experience on social media platforms, increasing
visibility and engagement.
